def colorize(value, vmin=None, vmax=None, cmap=None):
    """
    A utility function for TensorFlow that maps a grayscale image to a matplotlib
    colormap for use with TensorBoard image summaries.
    By default it will normalize the input value to the range 0..1 before mapping
    to a grayscale colormap.
    Arguments:
      - value: 2D Tensor of shape [height, width] or 3D Tensor of shape
        [height, width, 1].
      - vmin: the minimum value of the range used for normalization.
        (Default: value minimum)
      - vmax: the maximum value of the range used for normalization.
        (Default: value maximum)
      - cmap: a valid cmap named for use with matplotli
